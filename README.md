My http service! It need for getting Pearson correlation between 2 data arrays with date matching.

If you want use it you need:
- Flask 2.0.2
- Pymongo 4.0.1
- Pandas 1.3.5
- Numpy 1.22.0.
- Scipy 1.7.3
- Python 3.10
- Good mood :)

I have studied a lot of information and had great pleasure in creating this small project.

I want show that if I do not know somethink I always can use googl. 
I create my http service by flask becouse it it's a little simpler than on django.

For testing, I used Postman & MongoDB Compass. 


If you want using my service you have to follow the rule:
- The data_type value must match the key of these values.
